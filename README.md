# Test_Case_Prediction_RFC
RandomForest classifier for pass/fail prediction , OpenAI GPT-3.5 for AI-driven suggestions ,Excel file data processing ,Automated test case evaluation.


This project implements a machine learning model combined with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to predict the overall pass/fail status of test cases based on historical test data. It processes Excel files, aggregates test case data, and provides AI-generated suggestions to improve failed test cases. The RandomForest model is used to predict the outcome, and the project demonstrates the power of integrating AI with traditional machine learning for more insightful predictions and suggestions.
